I built a diet tracking app for those following the <Link to="https://meat.health/knowledge-base/carnivore-diet-what-to-eat/">Carnivore Diet</Link>. The mobile app only allows meat to be added as food entries and provides tools to help people following the carnivore diet to stay on track. In addition to adding food entries, users can view their entries in a calendar view as well as view statistics related to their meat consumption.
